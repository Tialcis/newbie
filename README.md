# INTRODUCTION
Traditional high-level programming languages are often too cryptic and difficult for new users to understand. The goal with Newbie is to create a pseudo-code like programming language aimed to simplify the programming experience for beginner developers. This will allow new coders the ability to design, implement  and better understand common algorithms without the frustration of learning specific programming syntax. Our standard library will specifically allow for easy implementation of basic algorithms involving linked lists, graphs, and trees.
